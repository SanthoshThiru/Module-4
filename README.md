# Module-4: PYTHON OOP, DICTIONARIES & I/O

This repository delves into key intermediate Python concepts, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with classes, advanced dictionary operations, robust exception handling, and file input/output (I/O).

## Topics Covered

Each Markdown file provides detailed explanations and examples for the following Python concepts:

* **Classes and Objects: Calculate the Area of a Circle**
    * Demonstrates defining a class and using objects to calculate the area of a circle.
    * *Files:* `Classes and Objects Calculate the Area of a Circ....md`, `areaofCircle_classes.png`

* **Dictionary: Merging Two Dictionaries**
    * Illustrates various methods for combining or merging two dictionaries in Python.
    * *Files:* `Dictionary: Merging Two Dictionaries.md`, `merge_dict.png`

* **Dictionary: Sort a Dictionary by Keys and Values**
    * Explores techniques for sorting dictionary items based on their keys or values.
    * *Files:* `Dictionary: Sort a Dictionary by Keys and Value....md`, `sortdict.png`

* **Exception Handling: Avoiding Index Errors**
    * Covers the use of `try-except` blocks to gracefully handle and prevent common `IndexError` exceptions.
    * *Files:* `Exception Handling: Avoiding Index Errors.md`, `indexerror.png`

* **File Handling: Count Lines Not Starting with 'T'**
    * Demonstrates reading from a file and processing its content to count lines that do not begin with a specific character.
